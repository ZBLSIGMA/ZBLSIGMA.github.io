<p>This paper examines New York City&rsquo;s Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP). SYEP provides jobs to youth ages 14-24, and due to high demand for summer jobs, allocates slots through a random lottery system. We match student-level data from the SYEP program with educational records from the NYC Department of Education and use the random lottery to estimate the effects of SYEP participation on a number of academic outcomes, including test taking and performance. We find that SYEP participation has positive impacts on student academic outcomes, and these effects are particularly large for students who participate in SYEP multiple times.</p>

<p><a href="/files/research/draft_CCPIC.pdf">Draft</a></p>
<p>Early child care experiences vary widely across the distribution of socio-economic status (SES), and sizeable skill gaps open up before children enter publicly-provided schooling. SES gradients in the quality of informal, relative-provided, care are particularly large. To understand how variation in the availability and quality of informal care contributes to skill inequality, I estimate a model of child care, mother labor supply, and child skill development, allowing for unequal access to informal care. I exploit the timing of grandmother deaths relative to a childâ€™s birth to identify substitution patterns between informal, formal, and mother-provided child care. I quantify the effect of having access to informal care on child development and mother labor supply, and I estimate that, for a substantial fraction of less-advantaged children, the availability of informal care is detrimental to skill development. I ex ante analyze the effects of policies such as universal public daycare, subsidies for formal care, and cash transfers, and show that accounting for heterogeneity in the availability and quality of informal care is quantitatively important for estimating the effect that such policies might have on skill inequality at the point of entry into K-12 schooling.</p>

<p><a href="/files/research/w29249.pdf">NBER Working Paper No. 29249</a></p>
<p>Using every major nationally-representative dataset on parental and non-parental care provided to children up to age 6, we quantify differences in American childrenâ€™s care experiences by socioeconomic status (SES), proxied primarily with maternal education. Increasingly, higher-SES children spend less time with their parents and more time in the care of others. Non-parental care for high-SES children is more likely to be in childcare centers, where average quality is higher, and less likely to be provided by relatives where average quality is lower. Even within types of childcare, higher-SES children tend to receive care of higher measured quality and higher cost. Inequality is evident at home as well: measures of parental enrichment at home, from both self-reports and outside observers, are on average higher for higher-SES children. We also find that parental and non-parental quality is reinforcing: children who receive higher quality non-parental care also tend to receive higher quality parental care. Head Start, one of the largest government care subsidy programs for low-income households, reduces inequality in care provided, but it is mainly limited to older children and to the lowest income households. Our evidence is from the pre-COVID-19 period, and the latest year we examine is 2019.</p>

<p><a href="">Draft (Coming Soon)</a></p>
<p>I consider how intra-family insurance between prime-age adults and their elderly parents
affects incentives to invest in the human capital of children. I document gradients in
skills and measures of investment in child human capital with respect to
grandparent wealth and health, even accounting for parent resources. Interpreting this
as suggesting evidence that grandparent resources shift savings and investment incentives
for parents, I jointly model the production of child skills and the consumption-savings
of parents and grandparents in an environment with income, health, and expenditure
risk and altruistic links but no commitment. I show that such a model provides sharp
predictions regarding the importance of intra-family insurance relative to bequests in
shifting parental incentives across the lifecycle. A calibrated version of the model is
able to qualitatively reproduce the investment gradients present in the data.</p>

<p><a href="">Draft (Coming Soon)</a></p>
<p>We consider how intra-family insurance affects household portfolio choices and savings decisions. Empirically,
we find that stock market participation and the fraction of assets invested in stocks are increasing in measures
of family member human capital. Taking this as suggestive evidence that intra-family insurance reduces risk aversion,
we study a model of consumption, savings, and portfolio choice with two-sided altruism and no commitment in which
parents and children can insure each other. In the model, agents with family members of lower human capital optimally
choose to hold lower portfolio weights, reducing the average rate of return obtained. Families with lower human capital
thus not only have lower labor income, but also lower rates of return, potentially propagating both the level and
persistence in wealth inequality.</p>

		<p><h2 id="human-capital-and-college-prospects">Human Capital and College Prospects</h2>
<p>This paper studies how parental investment in the human capital of children responds to changes 
in the college environment the child will face in late adolescence. I develop and estimate a dynamic
model of parental savings and investment in which parents make a trade-off between saving in financial 
assets or the human capital of their child. Parents care about their asset position at the end of the 
finite decision problem as well as the quality of college their child enjoys. College quality is produced 
by combining tuition dollars, a choice made by the parent, and the human capital of the child in the 
terminal period. These inputs are complementary, so policies that increase tuition spending on the child 
will increase the return to investing in one&rsquo;s child during childhood. I simulate three counterfactual 
education policies: an unconditional transfer, a conditional tuition grant, and a policy that approximates 
free public university. I find that such policies increase human capital investment the most in children 
from poor families, but the magnitudes of the increases are modest.</p>

<h3 id="with-noah-williams">with Noah Williams</h3>
<p>We study United States economic growth at the state level over the period from 1970-2015.
Our main contribution is the construction of new data series on capital at the state and industry level,
using data on the aggregate capital stock and payments to capital at the state and industry level.
We use published data and neoclassical theory to construct this data, as there are no official data
on investment or capital at the state level. We use this data to study capital accumulation and
convergence across states, as well as levels and trends in factor shares across states, regions, and industries.
We show that the decline in labor&rsquo;s share of income was strongest in states where it was initially the highest,
and while labor&rsquo;s share fell in manufacturing it increased in services. Thus even as manufacturing shrank and
services grew as a share of total output, labor&rsquo;s share declined overall. We then adopt a standard growth
accounting framework to investigate whether state growth during this period was due to capital accumulation,
a growing workforce, or total factor productivity growth. We find substantial heterogeneity in the growth
experiences of states. States with higher average output growth also had higher average productivity growth,
but a larger fraction of their growth was driven by factor accumulation. In addition, we decompose state
TFP growth into a component that captures growth within industries and one that characterizes productivity
growth due to factor reallocation towards more productive industries. We find that for most states, growth
is due to within-industry productivity growth as opposed to reallocation across industries, and in fact
reallocation effects generally slowed growth.</p>

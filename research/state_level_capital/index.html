<h3 id="with-noah-williams">with Noah Williams</h3>
<p>We study United States economic growth at the state level over the period from 1970-2015.
Our main contribution is the construction of new data series on capital at the state and industry level,
using data on the aggregate capital stock and payments to capital at the state and industry level.
We use published data and neoclassical theory to construct this data, as there are no official data
on investment or capital at the state level. We use this data to study capital accumulation and
convergence across states, as well as levels and trends in factor shares across states, regions, and industries.
We show that the decline in labor&rsquo;s share of income was strongest in states where it was initially the highest,
and while labor&rsquo;s share fell in manufacturing it increased in services. Thus even as manufacturing shrank and
services grew as a share of total output, labor&rsquo;s share declined overall. We then adopt a standard growth
accounting framework to investigate whether state growth during this period was due to capital accumulation,
a growing workforce, or total factor productivity growth. We find substantial heterogeneity in the growth
experiences of states. States with higher average output growth also had higher average productivity growth,
but a larger fraction of their growth was driven by factor accumulation. In addition, we decompose state
TFP growth into a component that captures growth within industries and one that characterizes productivity
growth due to factor reallocation towards more productive industries. We find that for most states, growth
is due to within-industry productivity growth as opposed to reallocation across industries, and in fact
reallocation effects generally slowed growth.</p>

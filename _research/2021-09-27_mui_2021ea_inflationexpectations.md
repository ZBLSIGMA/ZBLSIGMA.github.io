abstract: 'Inflation expectations play a key role in many influential macroeconomic models. Commentators and policymakers often use the results of, or structures from, these models without delving too far into the underlying methodology. However, on closer examination, it becomes clear that the standard models of "inflation expectations" are sharply at odds with the underlying data. As such, great caution should be exercised when making policy recommendations in response to reports of elevated "inflation expectations." An unthinking reliance on these models may lead one to prefer tighter monetary policy than would be optimal for securing a robust labor market recovery.'

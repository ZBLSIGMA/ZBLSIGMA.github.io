abstract: 'In the high-speed fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks, Mobile Edge Computing is tasked with assigning mobile users to the right servers to minimize response time. A crucial aspect of MEC is optimizing the migration of services based on user mobility, which is a complex problem that poses significant challenges for conventional optimization methods. To tackle this, we focused on developing an effective auxiliary task method leveraging multitasking. Our proposed solution, MFMA-AAT, uses a multifactorial memetic algorithm and adaptive auxiliary tasks based on community detection to optimize service migration in 5G MEC environments. Compared to traditional service migration solutions, MFMA-AAT provides a more efficient approach, and compared to classical multifactorial evolutionary algorithms, it overcomes the limitation of prior knowledge in constructing auxiliary tasks. Our experiments show that the adaptive selection of multiple auxiliary tasks through k-means clustering and memetic search based on MEC server community results in faster convergence.'

title: "A Note on the Convergence of Distributed RLS"
collection: research
status: 'published'
permalink: /research/TAC2021
abstract: 'This note focuses on the convergence problem
of a distributed recursive least squares (RLS) estimator,
which converges fast in many circumstances. We find that
the convergence behavior of this distributed RLS is quite
different for the scalar-parameter and high-dimensional parameter cases.'

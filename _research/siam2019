abstract: 'This paper derives a somewhat surprising but interesting result on the stabilizability
of discrete-time parameterized uncertain systems. Contrary to intuition, it shows that the nonlinear
nonlinear discrete-time control system. The densities of regular sets have also been computed for
both stabilizable and unstabilizable systems with scalar parameters. As indicated herein, the density
could be extremely sparse, while the corresponding system is stabilizable.'

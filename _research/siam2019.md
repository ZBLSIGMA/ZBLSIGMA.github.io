abstract: 'This paper derives a somewhat surprising but interesting result on the stabilizability
of discrete-time parameterized uncertain systems. Contrary to intuition, it shows that the nonlinear
growth rate of a discrete-time stabilizable system with linear parameterization is not necessarily
small all the time. More specifically, to achieve stabilizability, the system function $f(x) = O(\|x\|^b)$
with b < 4 is only required for a very tiny fraction of x in R, even if it grows exponentially fast
for the other x. This x set is called a regular set, whose density determines the stabilizability of a
nonlinear discrete-time control system. The densities of regular sets have also been computed for
both stabilizable and unstabilizable systems with scalar parameters. As indicated herein, the density
could be extremely sparse, while the corresponding system is stabilizable.'

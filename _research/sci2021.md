abstract: 'This paper focuses on the stabilizability problem for a basic class  
of discrete-time nonlinear  systems with multiple unknown parameters. We claim that such a system is stabilizable if its nonlinear growth rate is dominated by a polynomial rule. 
This rule cannot be relaxed in general since it becomes a necessary and sufficient condition when the system has a polynomial form [10].  We further prove that the concerned  stabilizable system is possible to grow exponentially fast. Meanwhile, optimality and closed-loop identification are also  discussed herein.'

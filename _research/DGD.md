abstract: 'Multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) is one of the most widely used evolutionary multitasking algorithms. MFEA implements knowledge transfer among optimization tasks via crossover and mutation operators, which achieves high-quality solutions more efficiently than the counterpart single-task evolutionary algorithms. Despite the effectiveness of MFEA in solving difficult optimization problems, there is no evidence of population convergence or theoretical explanations of how knowledge transfer increases algorithm performance. To fill this gap, we propose a new MFEA based on diffusion gradient descent (DGD) namely MFEA-DGD in this paper. We prove the convergence of DGD for multiple similar tasks and show that the local convexity of some tasks can help other tasks escape from local optimum by knowledge transfer. On this theoretical foundation, we design new complementary crossover and mutation operators in MFEA-DGD, such that the evolution population is endowed with a dynamic equation similar to DGD, i.e., the convergence is guaranteed and the benefit from knowledge transfer is explainable. A hyper-rectangular search strategy is also introduced to allow MFEA-DGD to explore more underdeveloped areas in the unified express space of all tasks and the subspace of each task. MFEA-DGD is verified on various multi-task optimization problems and the experimental results demonstrate that MFEA-DGD can convergence faster to competitive results in the comparison with other state-of-the-art evolutionary multitasking algorithms.

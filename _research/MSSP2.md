abstract: 'This paper is concerned with the inverse eigenvalue problem (IEP) for a “fixed-fixed” mass-spring-inerter
system. Unlike the “fixed-free” case, a “fixed-fixed” system has its both ends attached to the ground. This
brings some essential differences. We find that the construction strategy proposed in [1] cannot be readily
applied here. So we endeavor to develop a new strategy in this paper to solve the IEP and accordingly
derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the “fixed-fixed” system. '

abstract: 'I assess the role of labor market monopsony—finitely-elastic firm-specific labor supply—in the context of a New Keynesian model. Previous work has theorized that this feature is a source of real rigidity, permitting New Keynesian models to feature flatter Phillips curves, and thus smaller (and more realistic) responses of inflation to demand shocks. First, I modify a basic New Keynesian model to include firm-specific labor, and calibrate the labor supply elasticities to micro-empirical estimates.Consistent with this mechanism serving as a source of real rigidity, firm-specific labor substantially reduces the slope of the Phillips curve relative to the perfectly competitive labor market benchmark. However, this depends strongly on the elasticity chosen, and requires distinguishing the firm-specific and aggregate labor supply elasticities, which previous work often fails to do. Second, I provide a cross-sectional empirical test for this mechanism. I estimate the firm-specific labor supply elasticity by industry in the Survey of Income and Program Participation using a dynamic monopsony model. I then estimate industry responses to monetary policy shocks. Contrary to the New Keynesian model, I find no evidence that industry differences in firm-specific labor supply elasticities lead to different industry price responses to monetary policy shocks. My results do not support the theory that firm-specific labor is a source of real rigidity.'

title: "On the Convergence of Least Squares Estimator for  Nonlinear Autoregressive Models"
collection: research

permalink: /research/CCC2021
abstract: 'This paper is concerned with the least squares estimator for a basic class of nonlinear autoregressive models, whose
outputs are not necessarily to be ergodic. Several asymptotic properties of the least squares estimator have been established
under mild conditions. These properties suggest the strong consistency of the least squares estimates in nonlinear autoregressive
models which are not divergent.'

abstract: 'This paper advances [1] by deducing a stabilizability theorem for discrete-time nonlinear systems with scalar
parameters, which takes a step forward to the complete characterization of feedback limitations in discrete-time adaptive
nonlinear control. It is well-known that exponent 4 is an important critical number to characterize the feedback capability
for the basic discrete-time scalar-parameter systems, which are governed by power functions. As an application of our
theorem, a new critical number 2 is derived for a typical class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems with scalar
parameters.'

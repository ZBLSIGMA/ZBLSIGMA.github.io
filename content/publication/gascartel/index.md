abstract: "We analyze a hub-and-spoke cartel in the Brazilian automotive fuel industry. Based on court documents and detailed price and sales data, we discuss how gas stations owners (spokes) operating inside the federal capital received help from fuel distributors (hub) to reduce the dispersion and increase the level of the gasoline retail price. We provide evidence that distributors members benefited from the scheme by raising wholesale prices while excluding competitors from supplying to retail members. We also provide empirical evidence and theoretical ground for a new mechanism beyond information sharing that the hub can use to help spokes solve the obstacles of price coordination: smooth cost fluctuations."
